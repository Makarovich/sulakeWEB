{"name":"Sulakeweb","body":"### Welcome to the sulakeWEB Github Repository \r\n\r\n### About sulakeWEB\r\nsulakeWEB was created for the sole purpose of bringing some relevance back to the Habbo Hotel Development community. It is the only CMS built for habbo to primarily use a bunch of javascript, ajax, jquery, etc. code. It doesn't use any of Sulake's styling, because it sports a sleek black and white style created by the [main developer](http://forum.ragezone.com/members/823240.html) himself. sulakeWEB is still in development but pretty close to a release to watch out!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nsulakeWEB was created by Cobe 'Makarov'. It started out a small system but with the increasing knowledge and the developments of his side-project frameworks, sulakeWEB is flourished into a top-of-the-line, modern content management system.\r\n","tagline":"Step up from CMSulake, in it's second revision(Snobo)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
